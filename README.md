1. <h2> Solving Linear Programming in R:<h2/> <br/>Problem Statement:<br/>A car company produces 2 models, model A and model B. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least 100 model A cars and 80 model B cars each day. Because of limitations on production capacity, no more than 200 model A cars and 170 model B cars can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 200 cars much be shipped each day. If each model A car sold results in a $2000 loss, but each model B car produces a $5000 profit, how many of each type should be made daily to maximize net profits?<br/>
Here in this project, I used the lpsolve library in r to formulate the maximum profit.
2. <h2> Phyllotaxis-Draw flowers using mathematics:<h2/> <br/>
This is a tutorial project to draw flowers using mathematics. I have done this project using ggplot2 library in R.<br/>
